The palette images are stored as bmp files - uncompressed. The images are named with the name of the base image followed by the number of colors in the palette. The palette images are the same sizes as their base images; the first N pixels in the image's pixels array make up the palette, where N is the palette size (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256). The palette is repeated over and over until the pixels array is filled.
